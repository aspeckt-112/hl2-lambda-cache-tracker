# Half Life 2 Lambda Cache Tracker

## About
This is a small website that helps you track down the lambda caches in Half Life 2. It uses the `gamestate.txt` file to determine which caches you have found and which you have not.

## Design Philosophy
Given that I'm paying for the hosting the website, and that I'm not a front-end developer by day, I've tried to keep everything super simple and lightweight. The website is designed to be as fast as possible, and to work on as many devices as possible.

I don't ship any analytics, tracking code, cookies, ads or anything else that might slow down the website or invade your privacy. I don't even use Google Fonts, I just use the default system fonts.
I used vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without any frameworks or libraries. It's a basic, single page site and it doesn't need anything more than that.

Is it ugly? Yes. Is it fast? Yes. Does it work? Yes. That's all I care about.

Also, I've minimized the JavaScript and CSS files directly in the repo - so I don't need to run the process myself. Sorry if that's triggering for a front-end pro. :)

## Pull Requests
I'm happy to accept pull requests, but please keep in mind the design philosophy above. I'm not looking to add any new features. But if you find a bug, or want to improve the performance or accessibility of the website, I'm all ears.

## Thanks

The entire website is inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/2hno78/how_to_use_gamestatetxt_to_find_your_missing/?rdt=33109) reddit post. Massive props to Fenrakk101 - even 10 years later. Thanks!

YouTuber [Minxy](https://www.youtube.com/@minxy3805) uploaded a fantastic "get right to the point" video on where to find all the caches. I used this video to verify the cache locations for myself, and linked to it in the website. Thanks!

Valve, for making Half Life 2. It's a great game.
